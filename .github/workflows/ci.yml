  # Trigger workflow on push to main branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Trigger workflow on pull requests targeting main branch
  pull_request:

    strategy:
      matrix:
        # Test on Node.js 20.x (LTS) for stability
        node-version: [20.x]

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout repository code
    # This action checks out your repository so the workflow can access it
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
    # Configures the specified Node.js version and sets up npm caching
    - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds
        cache: 'npm'

    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    # Uses npm ci for clean, reproducible installs based on package-lock.json
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    # Step 4: Run linting
    # Checks code quality and style using ESLint
    - name: Lint code
      run: npm run lint
      # Continue on error to see build results even if linting fails
      continue-on-error: true

    # Step 5: Build the application
    # Compiles TypeScript and bundles the React app using Vite
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build

    # Step 6: Upload build artifacts
    # Saves the dist folder for potential deployment or inspection
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: dist/
        # Keep artifacts for 7 days
        retention-days: 7
